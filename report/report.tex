\begin{abstract}
In the robotics context, intelligent behaviours are often achieved using neural networks as controllers evolved with an evolutionary algorithm. 
In the case of multiple individuals within a species, controllers can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. 
In this paper, we use the competitive co-evolution in order to investigate its interaction with the relation between the homo and hetero cases.

\section{Literature}
 

\subsection{Co-evolution}
In \cite{stanley2004competitive} Stanley and Miikkulainen showed that by complexifying agent controllers in a competitive co-evolutionary setting, the added complexity could be utilized through the generation of advanced strategies.

\subsection{Homogeneity vs Heteroheneity}

\cite{potter2001heterogeneity} performed a study to a tradeoff of homogeneity versus heterogeneity in the control systems of robots by allowing teams to coevolve their high-level controllers given different levels of difficulty of the task
Hypothesised was that: “simply increasing the difficulty of a task is not enough to induce a team of robots to create specialists”. 
Task difficulty was varied by replacing one adversary's passive controller with an active variant supposedly proving that increased difficulty did not justify the use of heterogeneous controllers.
However, increased difficulty was never implemented structurally nor tested methodologically.
